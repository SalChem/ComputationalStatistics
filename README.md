An Introduction to Computational Statistics in Python
-----

Abstract
------
This workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to computational statistics. The focus will be on the efficient simulation of probabilities and statistics, for example the outcomes of dice rolling  or the results of an A/B test. By the end of the workshop, you should be able to apply bootstrapping and permutation testing to solve applied Data Science problems.

A working knowledge of Python (e.g., create variables and functions) is required. There are no math, probability, or statistics prerequisites. 

You'll be writing code during the workshop so please bring a laptop. All materials and resources will be provided.
